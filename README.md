## Problem Description
> To design a parking lot system with ability to find:
1) Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.

2) Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.

3) Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.

## Pre-requisites
The project is written using **Nodejs**. Make sure node is installed on your computer.Also **NPM(node package manager)** is also needed for installing dependencies. You can install both from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Run the Project
This project has two modes :-
1) **Interactive**
2) **File**

* **Interactive Mode**
	Open terminal and navigate to the project folder and run these commands :-
	* **npm install**
	* **npm start**

* **File Mode**
	Open terminal and navigate to the project folder and run the command :-
	
	**node src/index.js  <path_to_file.txt>**
	The sample format of the input file is similar to the  ./data/input.txt file. 

You can also run the **console application**. For that you have to build two binary files. A pre-reuisite to install these binary is  node and npm. The steps to create these binaries are -:
* **npm run setup** -> This will create a setup binary in the bin folder.
* **npm run build** -> This will create a parking_lot binary in the bin folder.

Now the steps to run the console application are as follows :-	
1) **./bin/setup** -> This setup binary will install all dependencies and will then run the unit test cases.
	
2) **./bin/parking_lot** -> This is the main project binary named parking_lot which will open the console application. It can also run with an input file as an argument. For eg. **./bin/parking_lot ./data/input.txt**

In the **scripts** segment below it is explained how these binaries are made.

## User Commands
1) **create_parking_lot < PARKING LOT SIZE >**: create_parking_lot 6

2) **park < REGISTRATION NUMBER > < COLOR >**: park KA-01-HH-1234 White will allocate the nearest slot from entry gate.

3) **leave <SLOT NUMBER>**: leave 4 will make slot number 4 free.

4) **status**: status will display cars and their slot details
	
5) **registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour < COLOR >**: registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White will display the registration number of the cars of white color

6) **slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour < COLOR >**: slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White will display slot numbers of the cars of white color 

6) **slot_number_for_registration_number < REGISTRATION NUMBER >**: slot_number_for_registration_number MH-04-AY-1111 will display the slot number for the car with registration number MH-04-AY-1111.

7) **exit**: exit will quit the application.

## Time Complexities
1) **create_parking_lot** -> O(n)

2) **park** -> O(log(n)) Mainly due to heap pop operation

3) **leave** -> O(log(n)) Mainly due to heap insert operation

4) **status** -> O(n) Mainly due to iterating the parking spots

5) **registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour** -> O(k) where k is the number of cars of the corresponding color

6) **slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour** ->  O(k) where k is the number of cars of the corresponding color

7) **slot_number_for_registration_number** -> O(1)

## Scripts
* **buildBinary.js** 
	npm run build -> Creates a binary named parking_lot of the project in bin folder

* **buildSetup.js**
	npm run setup -> Creates a binary named setup in the bin folder to install the dependecies and run unit tests

* **lintTest.js**
	npm run linter -> Runs and report esLint errors on the src and scripts folder

* **unitTest.js**
	npm run test -> Runs all the unit test cases in test/customTests.js file. **Mocha** framework and **Chai** assertion library has been used for unit testing.

* **createDocumentation.js**
	npm run createDocumentation -> It uses jsDoc module and creates a global.html in out folder which gives a details documentation of the code.

## Dependencies
* **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha.

* **Chai**: A BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and it can be paired with any JS testing framework. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai.

* **cli-color**: A npm module used to style terminal string. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-color.

* **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It covers both code quality and coding style issues. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint.

* **pkg**: It is used to package a Node.js project into an executable that can be run even on devices without Node.js installed. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg.

* **JSDoc**: An open source API documentation generator for Javascript. It allows developers to document their code through comments. It is supported only for Node.js versions > v8.15.0. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc.
