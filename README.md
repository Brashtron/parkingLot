## Problem Description
> To design a parking lot system with ability to find:
1) Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.

2) Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.

3) Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.

## Pre-requisites
The project is written using **Nodejs**. Make sure node is installed on your computer.Also **NPM(node package manager)** is also needed for installing dependencies. You can install both from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Setup and Usage
This project has two modes :-
1) **Interactive**
2) **File**

* **Interactive Mode**
	Open terminal and navigate to the project folder and run these commands :-
	* **npm install** -> installs project dependencies
	* **npm start** -> runs the project

* **File Mode**
	Open terminal and navigate to the project folder and run the command :-
	* **npm install** -> installs project dependencies
	* **node src/index.js  <path_to_file.txt>**
	The format of the input file is similar to the  sample format ./data/input.txt file. 

You can also run the **console application** directly. For that you have to build two binary files. A pre-requisite to install these binary is **node** and **npm** as mentioned earlier. The steps to create these binaries are -:
* **npm run setup** -> This will create a setup binary in the bin folder.
* **npm run build** -> This will create a parking_lot binary in the bin folder.

Now the steps to run the console application are as follows :-	
1) **./bin/setup** -> This setup binary will install all dependencies and will then run the unit test cases.
	
2) **./bin/parking_lot** -> This is the main project binary named parking_lot which will open the console application. It can also run with an input file as an argument. For eg. **./bin/parking_lot ./data/input.txt**

In the **scripts** segment below it is explained how these binaries are made.

## User Commands
1) **create_parking_lot < PARKING LOT SIZE >**: create_parking_lot 6

2) **park < REGISTRATION NUMBER > < COLOR >**: park KA-01-HH-1234 White will allocate the nearest slot from entry gate.

3) **leave <SLOT NUMBER>**: leave 4 will make slot number 4 free.

4) **status**: status will display cars and their slot details
	
5) **registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour < COLOR >**: registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White will display the registration number of the cars of white color

6) **slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour < COLOR >**: slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White will display slot numbers of the cars of white color 

7) **slot_number_for_registration_number < REGISTRATION NUMBER >**: slot_number_for_registration_number MH-04-AY-1111 will display the slot number for the car with registration number MH-04-AY-1111.

8) **available_slot_numbers**: available slot numbers in the parking lot

9) **leave_by_car_number <REGISTRATION NUMBER>** leave_by_car_number MH-04-AY-1111 will leave the spot occupied by this car.

10) **exit**: exit will quit the application.

## Logic of Parking Lot Class
* The parking lot class has a parkingSpot class object array of the maximum slot size which is taken as input while creating parking lot. 

* It also has another array parkingColorNode of doublyLinkedListNode class object. This class instance represents a standalone doubly linked list node. In this array each node corresponds to a parking spot position given by its index in this array. 

* It also has two maps, colorInfoMap and carInfoMap. ColorInfoMap stores cars of the same color in a doublyLinkedList where each node is parkingColorNode element corresponding to a parking slot position. CarInfoMap stores those individual nodes with key as car number. This second map provides ease in removing these nodes from doublyLinkedList and also provides parking slot info of a car in O(1).

* It also uses a minHeap to store the available slot indexes. Every time a car leaves a slot, that slot is entered in the minHeap and everytime a car is parked the smallest slot is popped.

## Time Complexities
1) **create_parking_lot** -> O(n)

2) **park** -> O(log(n)) Mainly due to heap pop operation

3) **leave** -> O(log(k)) where k are the available slots. Mainly due to heap insert operation

4) **status** -> O(n) Mainly due to iterating the parking spots

5) **registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour** -> O(k) where k is the number of cars of the corresponding color

6) **slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour** ->  O(k) where k is the number of cars of the corresponding color

7) **slot_number_for_registration_number** -> O(1)

8) **available_slot_numbers** -> O(klogk) where k are the available slots

9) **leave_by_car_number** -> O(log(k))  where k are the available slots. Mainly due to heap insert operation


## Scripts
* **buildBinary.js** 
	npm run build -> Creates a binary named parking_lot of the project in bin folder

* **buildSetup.js**
	npm run setup -> Creates a binary named setup in the bin folder to install the dependecies and run unit tests

* **lintTest.js**
	npm run linter -> Runs and report esLint errors on the src and scripts folder

* **unitTest.js**
	npm run test -> Runs all the unit test cases in test/customTests.js file. **Mocha** framework and **Chai** assertion library has been used for unit testing.

* **createDocumentation.js**
	npm run createDocumentation -> It uses jsDoc module and creates a global.html in out folder which gives a details documentation of the code.

## Dependencies
* **Mocha**: A JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha.

* **Chai**: A BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and it can be paired with any JS testing framework. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai.

* **cli-color**: A npm module used to style terminal string. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-color.

* **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It covers both code quality and coding style issues. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint.

* **pkg**: It is used to package a Node.js project into an executable that can be run even on devices without Node.js installed. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg.

* **JSDoc**: An open source API documentation generator for Javascript. It allows developers to document their code through comments. It is supported only for Node.js versions > v8.15.0. Learn more https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc.
